## Django project for learning

It would be to nice have the following

* Users authentication ‚Äì sign in / sign out
* Something like a blog
    - Articles
    - Rating
    - Comments
* Contact with email etc
* Chat box to search what you need to find
* REST API

And later on and very ambitious

* Load your data file + functionallities
* Explore it in tables
* Present it with graphs (interactive)
    - Is it possible from graph manipulation to data manipulation in the back end?

Then it gets more ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù depending on the need of what you want to do with the data
* ML -  AI ‚Äì Analytics
